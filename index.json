This website is also designed to promote interactivity. You are encouraged to comment on an assignment page if you have any questions. Questions can be answered by fellow students or the instructor. If a question is asked for which a detailed explanation will benefit the entire class, a seperate page will be made to answer that question.\nWhy Mineral Processing Lab? Mines sell a product to a customer. The product was obtained by processing material removed from the earth.\nDuring your career you will make decisions and interact with people. The decisions of a mine operator, engineer, or equipment designer effect the quality of the product or the quantity produced. You may interact with executives (or become one yourself), sales, or a customer. You need to be able to understand and describe how one product differs from another, as well as the costs associated with those differences.\nFirst hand knowledge of how to quantify specifications and costs of a product is necessary for any individual involved in producing that product. Executives at amazon understand the costs involved in how they process their products including transportation, warehousing, and packaging costs, as well as the importance of presenting information and adequately describing their products to their customers. For an individual working in the mining industry, it is just as important to understand the costs related to and differences in processed mineral products.\n","date":1584316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1584316800,"objectID":"e5f4230326ef369c78cd70cbafd201bb","permalink":"/courses/mine-3544-mineral-processing-lab/","publishdate":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/mine-3544-mineral-processing-lab/","section":"courses","summary":"Easy to access portal for MINE 3544, Mineral Processing Lab","tags":null,"title":"Overview","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lab 1 Assignment\n","date":1584226800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584226800,"objectID":"e03e6b868b6626b225ae7384db224920","permalink":"/courses/mine-3544-mineral-processing-lab/lab1/","publishdate":"2020-03-15T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/courses/mine-3544-mineral-processing-lab/lab1/","section":"courses","summary":"Lab 1 Assignment","tags":null,"title":"Lab 1 Introduction","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lab 2\n","date":1584226800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584226800,"objectID":"57e004b80a4dd0372a38406b36371bfa","permalink":"/courses/mine-3544-mineral-processing-lab/example1/","publishdate":"2020-03-15T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/courses/mine-3544-mineral-processing-lab/example1/","section":"courses","summary":"Lab 2","tags":null,"title":"Lab 2 Sampling and Splitting","type":"docs"},{"authors":["Scott Koermer"],"categories":["Software"],"content":" The BayesMassBal (V. 0.2.0) package, used for Bayesian data reconciliation of a chemical or particulate process, is now available from CRAN.\nThe purpose of this package is to make the advantages Bayesian data reconciliation more accessible to students, professionals, and educators.
