Mines sell a product to a customer. The product was obtained by processing material removed from the earth.\nDuring your career you will make decisions and interact with people. The decisions of a mine operator, engineer, or equipment designer effect the quality of the product or the quantity produced. You may interact with executives (or become one yourself), sales, or a customer. You need to be able to understand and describe how one product differs from another, as well as the costs associated with those differences.\nFirst hand knowledge of how to quantify specifications and costs of a product is necessary for any individual involved in producing that product. Executives at amazon understand the costs involved in how they process their products including transportation, warehousing, and packaging costs, as well as the importance of presenting information and adequately describing their products to their customers. For an individual working in the mining industry, it is just as important to understand the costs related to and differences in processed mineral products.\n","date":1584316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1584316800,"objectID":"e5f4230326ef369c78cd70cbafd201bb","permalink":"/courses/mine-3544-mineral-processing-lab/","publishdate":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/mine-3544-mineral-processing-lab/","section":"courses","summary":"Easy to access portal for MINE 3544, Mineral Processing Lab","tags":null,"title":"Overview","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lab 1 Assignment\n","date":1584226800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584226800,"objectID":"e03e6b868b6626b225ae7384db224920","permalink":"/courses/mine-3544-mineral-processing-lab/lab1/","publishdate":"2020-03-15T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/courses/mine-3544-mineral-processing-lab/lab1/","section":"courses","summary":"Lab 1 Assignment","tags":null,"title":"Lab 1 Introduction","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lab 2\nCalcuations Bucket Fill Fraction If you go into the field to collect a sample, you very well may not have a scale. If you have a 55 gallon drum, or a 1 gallon bucket, it is helpful to understand what fraction of that bucket to fill in order to obtain a large enough sample.\nFor this lab exercise, we will collecting a 4 kg sample in a 2 gallon bucket with an ore to then split into 4 1 kg lots. What fraction of the bucket should we fill up to obtain a 4 kg sample? We are given the following information:\n 2 gallon bucket 3.785 L = 1 gal Crushed ore has 30% void space Density of the solid ore is about 2.65 g/cm3  We can assume the mass of air is negligible.\nUsing the above information, we know that:\n$$ \\rho_\\mathrm{ore} = \\frac{m_\\mathrm{ore}}{V_\\mathrm{ore}} $$\nWe also know that the mass of air is negligible, so:\n$$\\begin{aligned} m_\\mathrm{sample} \u0026amp;= m_\\mathrm{ore} + \\xcancel{m_\\mathrm{air}} \\\\ m_\\mathrm{sample} \u0026amp;= m_\\mathrm{ore} \\end{aligned}$$\nBecause $m_\\mathrm{sample} = m_\\mathrm{ore}$, we can simply use the formula for density and given information to find $V_\\mathrm{ore}$:\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\rho_\\mathrm{ore} \u0026amp;= \\frac{m_\\mathrm{ore}}{V_\\mathrm{ore}} \\\\\n2.65 \\frac{g}{cm^3} \u0026amp;= \\frac{4,000 g}{V_\\mathrm{ore}}\\\\\nV_\\mathrm{ore} \u0026amp; \\approx 1509 cm^3 \\approx 1.51 L \\end{aligned} $$\nNext, we can use the information about void space to calculate the $V_\\mathrm{air}$ and then $V_\\mathrm{sample}$. First writing down the volume relationship for void space, converting the 30% void space into a fraction:\n$$ 0.3 = \\frac{V_\\mathrm{air}}{V_\\mathrm{ore} + V_\\mathrm{air}} $$\nSubstituting in $V_\\mathrm{ore} = 1.51L$ and solving for $V_\\mathrm{air}$ gives:\n$$ \\begin{aligned} 0.3 \u0026amp;= \\frac{V_\\mathrm{air}}{1.51 + V_\\mathrm{air}} \\\\\n0.3 \\times 1.51 + 0.3V_\\mathrm{air} \u0026amp;= V_\\mathrm{air} \\\\\n0.3 \\times 1.51 \u0026amp;= (1-0.3) V_\\mathrm{air}\\\\\nV_\\mathrm{air} \u0026amp;= \\frac{0.3 \\times 1.51}{(1-0.3)}\\\\\nV_\\mathrm{air} \u0026amp;= 0.647 L \\end{aligned} $$\nSo now we can calculate our total volume:\n$$ \\begin{aligned} V_\\mathrm{sample} \u0026amp;= V_\\mathrm{ore} + V_\\mathrm{air}\\\\\nV_\\mathrm{sample} \u0026amp;= 1.51L + 0.647L \\\\\nV_\\mathrm{sample} \u0026amp;= 2.16 \\end{aligned} $$\nAnd converting 2 gal = 7.57 L we can see that:\n\\begin{align} pct_\\mathrm{bucket} \u0026amp;= \\frac{V_\\mathrm{sample}}{V_\\mathrm{bucket}} \\times 100 \\\\\npct_\\mathrm{bucket} \u0026amp;= \\frac{2.16 L}{7.57 L} \\times 100 \\\\\npct_\\mathrm{bucket} \u0026amp;= 28.5 pct \\\\\n\\mathrm{frac}_\\mathrm{bucket} \u0026amp;\\approx \\frac{1}{3} \\end{align}\nSo for a two gal bucket, we need to fill up about $\\frac{1}{3}$ to obtain approximately a 4 kg sample.\n","date":1584226800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584226800,"objectID":"57e004b80a4dd0372a38406b36371bfa","permalink":"/courses/mine-3544-mineral-processing-lab/example1/","publishdate":"2020-03-15T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/courses/mine-3544-mineral-processing-lab/example1/","section":"courses","summary":"Lab 2\nCalcuations Bucket Fill Fraction If you go into the field to collect a sample, you very well may not have a scale.

This is consistent with the typical grade recovery curve. If recovery is 100%, the grade has to be the feed grade to the process because it is so difficult to get every single particle into the concentrate. We can never get 100% recovery, we can only asymptotically approach 100% recovery. Similarly, we cannot reach 100% grade. Theoretically, if grade is 100% then recovery approaches 0. 100% grade is like if you had a 10,000 ton pile of of rock with a 100 lb of tiny gold particles in it and you picked one of the gold flakes out with tweezers. You would have a 100% grade concentrate, but practically 0% recovery.\n Grade vs. SE Next we know separation efficiency is calculated as:\n\\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{SE} = \\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{Cu}} - \\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{SiO}_2}\\label{eq:SE} \\end{equation}\\]\nWhere \\(\\mathrm{R}_x\\) is the recovery of component \\(x\\). On the plot, you are seeing that for an increase in grade you are seeing an increase in separation efficiency. In our observed data, recovery does not change much. Lets pretend that it does not change at all. If \\(\\mathrm{R}_\\mathrm{Cu}\\) is unchanged, but grade increases, this means that the \\(\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{SiO}_2}\\) must have decreased. Keeping this assumption in mind, these points seem to make sense.\nObviously, this upward trend cannot continue forever. At the maximum \\(\\mathrm{Cu}\\) grade, determined by the \\(\\mathrm{Cu}\\) content in \\(\\mathrm{CuFeS}_2\\), we would recover a speck of \\(\\mathrm{CuFeS}_2\\), and no \\(\\mathrm{SiO}_2\\). This would make \\(\\mathrm{SE} = \\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{Cu}} - \\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{SiO}_2} \\approx 0-0\\). Therefore the the true line connecting the \\(\\mathrm{SE}\\) points may look something like this:\nHowever, is the process actually going to get 100% recovery of copper? If so, can we really say at what grade? A more conservative approach, knowing the relationship between grade and \\(\\mathrm{SE}\\) is shown below:\n   Plot 2 We know that:\n\\[ \\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{CuFeS}_2} = \\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{Cu}} \\]\nBecause \\(\\mathrm{CuFeS}_2\\) is the only copper containing mineral present. Keeping this in mind the resulting plot looks like:\n\\(\\mathrm{CuFeS}_2\\) Recovery vs. \\(\\mathrm{SiO}_2\\) Rejection Similar to grade, vs. recovery, we know that as \\(\\mathrm{SiO}_2\\) rejection increases, recovery will decrease. We see this trend in the data. However, we can only guess as to what happens for an \\(\\mathrm{SiO}_2\\) rejection. It makes sense to draw a straight line from the last data point to \\((100,0)\\)\n \\(\\mathrm{SE}\\) vs. \\(\\mathrm{SiO}_2\\) Rejection We know that:\n\\(\\mathrm{J}_{\\mathrm{SiO}_2} = 100 - \\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{SiO}_2}\\)\nWhere \\(\\mathrm{J}_x\\) is the rejection of component \\(x\\). Therefore Equation becomes:\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} \\mathrm{SE} \u0026amp;= \\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{CuFeS}_2} - \\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{SiO}_2}\\\\ \u0026amp; = \\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{CuFeS}_2} - (100-\\mathrm{J}_{\\mathrm{SiO}_2})\\\\ \u0026amp; = \\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{CuFeS}_2} + \\mathrm{J}_{\\mathrm{SiO}_2} - 100 \\end{aligned} \\]\nThe equation above shows that as \\(\\mathrm{SiO}_2\\) rejection increases, \\(\\mathrm{SE}\\) increases. However, we have to keep in mind the relationship between \\(\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{CuFeS}_2}\\) and \\(\\mathrm{J}_{\\mathrm{SiO}_2}\\). When \\(\\mathrm{J}_{\\mathrm{SiO}_2} \\to 100\\%\\), \\(\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{CuFeS}_2} \\to 0\\%\\), making:\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} \\mathrm{SE} \u0026amp; = \\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{CuFeS}_2} + \\mathrm{J}_{\\mathrm{SiO}_2} - 100\\\\ \u0026amp;= 0 + 100 - 100\\\\ \u0026amp; = 0 \\% \\end{aligned} \\]\nSo we know that although \\(\\mathrm{SE}\\) is trending upwards, the sudden downward change in recovery will cause \\(\\mathrm{SE}\\) to eventually reach the point \\((100,0)\\). We don’t know when, but a good guess is to just draw a straight line.\n  ","date":1613260800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613260800,"objectID":"e290d231d3f0b7394fc74b2a68524c27","permalink":"/courses/mine-3544-mineral-processing-lab/lab-5/","publishdate":"2021-02-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/mine-3544-mineral-processing-lab/lab-5/","section":"courses","summary":"Lab 5\nData:   \\(\\mathrm{Cu}\\) Grade  \\(\\mathrm{Cu}\\) Recovery  \\(\\mathrm{SiO}_2\\) Rejection  SE      1.98  96.12  67.85  63.","tags":[],"title":"Lab 5 Flotation","type":"docs"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Lab 6\n","date":1613260800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613260800,"objectID":"39fb5bc11cd29f7e650b4c2b007ca47c","permalink":"/courses/mine-3544-mineral-processing-lab/lab-6/","publishdate":"2021-02-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/mine-3544-mineral-processing-lab/lab-6/","section":"courses","summary":"Lab 6","tags":[],"title":"Lab 6 Crushing Plant Simulation","type":"docs"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Lab 7\n Further Instructions Data Records \u0026amp; Calculations Part A For the table in Part A, watch the video and record your observations for each of the three test conditions.

The flocculant is blocking the coagulant from bringing larger flocs of particles together due to repulsion forces.\nDescribe this process in your own words.\n","date":1613260800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613260800,"objectID":"fc0e5ac5b641c003e2b84a6d04a68608","permalink":"/courses/mine-3544-mineral-processing-lab/lab-7/","publishdate":"2021-02-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/mine-3544-mineral-processing-lab/lab-7/","section":"courses","summary":"Lab 7\n Further Instructions Data Records \u0026amp; Calculations Part A For the table in Part A, watch the video and record your observations for each of the three test conditions.","tags":[],"title":"Lab 7 Thickening","type":"docs"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Lab 8\n","date":1613260800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613260800,"objectID":"1dec52334f900181ac282b7ebe29e358","permalink":"/courses/mine-3544-mineral-processing-lab/lab-8/","publishdate":"2021-02-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/mine-3544-mineral-processing-lab/lab-8/","section":"courses","summary":"Lab 8","tags":[],"title":"Lab 8 Assay and Analysis","type":"docs"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Lab 9\n ","date":1613260800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613260800,"objectID":"3321351cdbb51c221b349a4544e875d5","permalink":"/post/lab-9/","publishdate":"2021-02-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/lab-9/","section":"post","summary":"Lab 9\n ","tags":[],"title":"Lab 9 Electrostatic Separation","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"  Project Description\n  Proposal Guide\n  Proposal Technical Rubric\n  Proposal Writing Rubric\n  Proposal Objective You are working at VT MinE Inc. and are tasked with solving one of two problems.

You can install the latest public version of BayesMassBal with the following line of code in R studio:\ninstall.packages(\u0026quot;BayesMassBal\u0026quot;) This announcement coincides with the publication of the article The utility of Bayesian data reconciliation for separations in Minerals Engineering. If you are unable to access the journal article, you can access it here for free for the next 50 or so days.\nModels in The utility of Bayesian data reconciliation for separations allow for a machine learning based approach to mass balancing plant or laboratory data as well as improvements in accuracy due to improved uncertainty quantification and the use of truncated normal error.\nWhat is BayesMassBal? The BayesMassBal package is intended to provide process engineering students and professionals easy access to the Bayesian mass balance methods outlined in The utility of Bayesian data reconciliation for separations. The free and open source package is available from CRAN for the R programming language.\nIf you feel that the software is difficult to use, or you have suggestions for improvement, please contact me, I would love to hear your feedback!\n Why BayesMassBal? The mass balance models available in BayesMassBal have the following features:\n Full uncertainty quantification for the mass balanced values Machine learning model selection methods to find which mass balance model is a better fit for a data set Error truncated at 0, advantageous for extremely low grade samples where Gaussian error is not appropriate Tools are provided with BayesMassBal which allow the user to organize all of their data in Excel before importing data into R.  After installing BayesMassBal you can type system.file(\"extdata\", \"twonode_constraints.csv\",package = \"BayesMassBal\") into the R console to find an example on your computer of how to create a .csv file with your process constraints. Similarly, the file at the location found using system.file(\"extdata\", \"twonode_example.csv\", package = \"BayesMassBal\") shows how to organize process data before importing into R. These two files correspond with the Two_Node_Process vignette.\n What’s next? Some readers have told me they are looking forward to the next publication in this area. Thanks for the positive feedback, I’m looking forward to writing the next publication!\nMy research in this area is slightly different than the rest of the research for my PhD dissertation, applying Bayesian inference to mass balance models is truly a personal interest and curiosity. There will be another publication. However as the rest of my PhD dissertation is in another area of applied Bayesian modeling, and I am hoping to graduate in the Fall, it might be a while.\nFurthermore, there are many possibilities for the next publication, it is difficult to choose just a few to work on. Some options for the next publication include but are not limited to:\n Improved computation time via alternative algorithms for taking draws from the truncated multivariate normal distribution. Implementation in python. More plotting functions to improve ease of use. Further sensitivity analysis applications, using Bayesian inference to understand the implication of sales contract terms. Time correlated data: a Bayesian competitor to BILMAT. Mass balancing, modeling, and statistical comparison of data sets with different process parameters. Use of a mixture of truncated normal distributions to model complex error structures.  Any input as to what you would like to see next is welcome.\n ","date":1623024000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1623095712,"objectID":"445e108400f27bf44141bd9027a77f28","permalink":"/publication/software/the-utility-of-bayesian-data-reconciliation-for-separations/","publishdate":"2021-06-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/software/the-utility-of-bayesian-data-reconciliation-for-separations/","section":"publication","summary":"Publication in Minerals Engineering overviewing the statistical theory and models available in the `BayesMassBal` V 1.0.0 `R` package.","tags":["Bayesian Inference","Mass Balance","Modeling","R","Software","Machine Learning","Economic Modeling"],"title":"The utility of Bayesian data reconciliation for separations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Scott Koermer"],"categories":["Software"],"content":"  The BayesMassBal (V. 0.2.0) package, used for Bayesian data reconciliation of a chemical or particulate process, is now available from CRAN.\nThe purpose of this package is to make the advantages Bayesian data reconciliation more accessible to students, professionals, and educators.
